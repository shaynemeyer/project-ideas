## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ **Over-engineering**: Don't build features users don't need
2. ❌ **Poor tenant isolation**: Test thoroughly, one bug = disaster
3. ❌ **Ignoring mobile**: 40% of landscapers use mobile primarily
4. ❌ **Complex pricing**: Start simple, iterate based on feedback
5. ❌ **No onboarding**: Users need hand-holding initially
6. ❌ **Premature optimization**: Build first, optimize later
7. ❌ **Feature creep**: Stay focused on core job board + invoicing
8. ❌ **Ignoring performance**: Slow app = churned users

---

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest landscaping-crm --typescript --tailwind --app
   cd landscaping-crm
   npm install drizzle-orm postgres
   npm install -D drizzle-kit
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   ```

2. **Set up database**
   - Sign up for Neon or Supabase
   - Create database
   - Save connection string to .env.local

3. **Set up authentication**
   - Sign up for Clerk
   - Install Clerk SDK
   - Configure authentication

4. **Create first schema**
   - Start with tenants and users tables
   - Run first migration
   - Test tenant isolation

5. **Build first feature**
   - Start with client management
   - Simple CRUD operations
   - Test with multiple tenants
